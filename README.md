## ‚õî Disclaimer
This is not my original project idea. I got this idea from a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSSBbv2fc2s) video by John Hammond, and I want to thank him and all the people who have contributed to it. All the credit goes to them.

## üìñ Description 
Casnote is an executable binary designed for extracting any Notepad cache in Windows 11. Since the new Notepad has the ability to close without saving any files, when reopened, it will restore the last edited or saved item. This is because it has a cache file in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\TabState\`, which anyone can read.

###### Prebuilt release right [here](https://github.com/shafiqaimanx/cashnote/releases)!
